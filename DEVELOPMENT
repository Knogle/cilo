1. Adding a new platform
    0) Create a mach/${PLATFORM} directory, which must contain the platform-
       specific I/O routines for user interface and filesystem access.
    1) Specify platform storage types, setup platform specific access methods
       and strategies, or fall back on the defaults
    2) Create platform-specific c_putc, c_getc, c_memsz
    3) Create a platform_init() method; this will be the first method to be
       called from start_bootloader(). This must register platform-specific
    4) Build up any re-usable peripheral methods required - for example, if
       your platform requires a new filesystem class (that may be seen in
       other platforms), please add support for it in filesys.

2. Directory Structure
    -> / - entry points, simple, common code
       -> storage/ - the storage manager registering multiple storage classes
       -> console/ - console I/O drivers
       -> net/ - networking code (future)
       -> mach/ - machine-specific code
          -> c3600 - support for the Cisco 3600 Series
          -> c1750 - support for the Cisco 1750 Series
          -> c3725 - support for the Cisco 3725 Multiservice Router
       -> include/ - headers for generic code
